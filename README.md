## Description:
This is the source code for the project Aigen Intellifield. This code does not include any dataset files since the datasets provided by Aigen are proprietary. When you run the project locally, some visualizations and graphs might be missing. All graphs shown are either generic or synthetic.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install the following packages before running the development server locally:

```bash
npm install react react-dom mapbox-gl
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.









You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
