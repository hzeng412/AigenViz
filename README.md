## Description:
This is the source code for the project Aigen Intellifield. This code does not include any dataset files since the datasets provided by Aigen are proprietary. When you run the project locally, some visualizations and graphs might be missing. All graphs shown are either generic or synthetic.

Mapbox is the online map tool used. We have deleted the Mapbox token used for the project. If you want the map to appear, go to [https://console.mapbox.com/account/access-tokens/](https://console.mapbox.com/account/access-tokens/) and generate you own token to put in the code.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install the following packages before running the development server locally. 

```bash
npm install react react-dom mapbox-gl
```

You might need to install some more packages if necessary.


Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
